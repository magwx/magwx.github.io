Hello! Welcome to the hidden side/site. 

I'm a Computer geek who started from Mechanics but happened to obtain a Mathematics degree, a mechanician with techniques of mathematics and programming, or an applied mathematician that works on mechanical problems while using computer skills, depending on your point of view.

I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and it's currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). It doubles as my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume "GWX's Resume") and, maybe in the future, a place to post notes, code fragments, random thoughts and anything interesting.

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a> me if you have any questions or comments.
